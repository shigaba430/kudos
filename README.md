The Kudos Contract is a simple Clarity smart contract that enables users to send appreciation points ("kudos") to each other on the Stacks blockchain.

It is designed for communities, DAOs, and apps where members want to acknowledge contributions in a transparent, verifiable way.

Features

Send kudos to another user (principal address).

Track how many kudos each user has received.

Prevent self-kudos (users cannot send kudos to themselves).

Fully on-chain, transparent, and auditable.
